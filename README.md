Pet Rock Goes on an Adventure
A story about a rock who gets the chance to go on a small adventure. But you need to help him in the mini reaction game. 

I made this my game because I like action story games so I wanted to try creating the type of game that I like. 

When creating this game a big way for me to test my code was by using console.log('hi'). This was used at any point where I had an event listener so that I knew I could continue. 

I feel as though this project allowed me to feel a lot more comfortable and understanding of things such as event listeners. set timeouts, and making a carousel.

How to play:
Follow rocks story as he summons a wizard then asks you to go on an adventure with his. When you say "Lets Go" you will be on an adventure catching fireflies with rock. To catch the firelfies you need to click on them before they disappear.
